In my spare time, I [translate xkcd comics into Chinese](https://xkcd.in/). I also engage in activities with [TAA](https://taa-madison.org/) as a grad student, with Departmental Psych Colloquium Committee as a Psych grad student and a web/graphic designer, and with [Chinese Psychelogos](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/tDRr-7AKNKL_DQHjM3jpfA) as a Chinese Psych grad student. -->
